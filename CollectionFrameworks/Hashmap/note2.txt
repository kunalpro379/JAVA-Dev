Map does not extend the collection interface
Key charactaristics :
key value pairs: each entry in a map consists of a key and a value
Uniwue keys: No two entries can have the same key
One value per key:  Each key maps to a single value
Order : Some Implementations maintain insertion order
(LinkedHashMap), natural order (TreeMap) or no order (HashMap)
